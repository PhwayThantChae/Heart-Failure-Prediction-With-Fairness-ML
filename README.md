# Heart-Failure-Prediction-With-Fairness-ML

This project investigates fairness metrics of various classification models on the Heart Failure Prediction dataset on Kaggle using the FairLearn library. Four models (logistic regression, standard vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) were created to predict heart failure using all the features of the dataset. After constructing the model, fairness metrics were calculated using accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and the selection rate. Two bias reduction techniques were performed to see if fairness could be improved: demographic parity and equalized odds.
